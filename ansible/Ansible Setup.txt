Centos 

sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible



Ubuntu 22.04:
-------------

sudo apt update 
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible

check the installation using ansible --version


SSH connection among (CONTROL_NODE & HOST_NODES)& Ansible installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) create users in both control & host nodes as below

sudo adduser masteruser
sudo adduser hostuser 

2) enable passwordless sudo on these users

sudo visudo

give same permissions as root 
masteruser ALL:ALL NOPASSWD:ALL .....

3) Generate a public key in the CONTROL_NODE

ssh-keygen

this creates a ".ssh" folder where you can find "id_rsa" "id_rsa.pub" 

cat id_rsa.pub -> displays pub key

4) connect to HOST_NODE
su host1

mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
sudo touch authorized_keys
paste the CONTROL_NODE'S key inside authorized_keys file

5) Then try doing SSH from CONTROL_NODE TO HOST_NODE using below command 
sudo ssh host1@172.31.41.67...

you can connect successfully by now 

6) In CONTROL_NODE, Add hosts under inventory file i.e., /etc/ansible/hosts

i.e: 
[apphosts]
host1 ansible_ssh_host=host1@172.31.41.67...







ansible setup on Amazon Linux:
===============================

connect to "root" user and add user like below and give "sudo permissions" to that user

"sudo permissions" => A sudo permitted user can perform sudo operatiions without 
actually giving the password everytime


Master :
==============================================================================

1) connect to "root" user
2) add user on both machines

	useradd ansible
	passwd ansible

3) Make user as "sudo user" like below

	i)visudo -> this opens up a file

		Now user is able to perform sudo operations

	ii) vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config => Edit 61 th line   PasswordAuthentication no to  PasswordAuthentication yes

4) After above step Restart "sshd" service
	systemctl restart sshd

5) Switch user from root to ansible user 
	su ansible 
	cd 

6) Now install ansible on master as we have sudo permissions

	i) sudo yum install epel-release 
	ii) sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel
	iii) sudo yum install -y ansible 
	iv) ansible --version
		you will be able to see the version & rleated config info like "/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg"

7) vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
	uncomment like below 
	inventory /etc/ansible/hosts
	sudo_user from root to ansible

8) Add host IP addresses in the inventory file(/etc/ansible/hosts)/etc/ansible/hosts
	vi /etc/ansible/hosts

	[agents]
	12.34.5.7 ansible_user = <user_name of host> 

9) Try doing SSH connection to Host machine/node/agent
	ssh <user_name>@12.34.5.7
	when prompted for yes/no ? give yes => This IP will be added to known_hosts

10) Generate SSH key 
	ssh-keygen -t rsa 
	this generates id_rsa, id_rsa.pub

11) copy id_rsa.pub to authorized keys of host/agent nodes manually 
	or
     ssh-copy-id <username>@12.34.5.7 => this copied key to authorized_keys file if exists, if doesn't exist it 
	creates "authorized_keys" and places the key inside
12) now try doing SSH communication to host/agent nodes

	ssh <username>@12.3.45.5

13) ping host nodes as below 
	ansible -m ping all




Slave machine:
================
1) connect to root
sudo su 

2) Add user 
useradd ansible
passwd ansible 


3) make this user a sudo user

make changes in => visudo & /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

4) Restart sshd service
	systemctl restart sshd

5) Switch user
su ansible

6) ssh-keygen
